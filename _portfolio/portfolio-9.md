# Overview
* Developed a new automotive energy conversion system. The research background is the low battery life of electric vehicles and few electric charging stations.
* The purpose of this research is to use a rotary engine to drive the vehicle and charge the battery while the battery is low. When the battery is fully charged, use the battery to drive the vehicle. This research uses the high-performance rotor engine and clean natural gas as the energy source to achieve the highest driving efficiency and the lowest environmental pollution.
