# Overview
Developed a new type of automotive battery cooling system to prevent current electric vehicles, such as Tesla's Model X, from overheating and to ensure safe driving.

# What I Did
This research mechanically designed a new pulsating heat pipe and experimentally changed the working fluid inside the pulsating heat pipe to obtain different heat dissipation results, and finally obtained the optimal working condition.
