# Overview
My project is to study the dynamic system of long jump. In the modeling part, I used three links to representa manâ€™sbody, thigh,and calf. In the external force part, to makehim jump, I added forces in the x and y directions to the calf. In the degrees of freedom part, in total, I used three angle parameters and two position parameters to represent the specific position and postureof the manduring the entire jumping process. In the impact part, afterhis feettouched the ground,his feetmade contact with the ground and a plastic impactoccurred. See codes [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1esYyp-ViELlXDnCdz3dagsVTCIKS7pf8) and README [here](https://github.com/ZhishengLin2020/me314-theory-of-machines-dynamics).
